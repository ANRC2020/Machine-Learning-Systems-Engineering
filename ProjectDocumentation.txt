The purpose of this lab was to deploy the application we have developed in lab 3 and tested in minikube to the azure kubernates service 
server. This lab required no changes to the actual code from the previous lab and focused on updating the overlay files to be correctly
configured for deployment. 

After updating the namespace to my own (asiddiqui6) in the overlay files and submission-namespace.yaml, as well as updating the tag of the 
image being pushed to the azure container registry (ACR), we're ready to deploy and we can do so in the following way:

1. Sign in and authenticate into the Azure Workspace: az login --tenant berkeleydatasciw255.onmicrosoft.com
2. Set the subscription to the one being used for our class (should be done by default); if its not we can use:

    az account set --subscription=0257ef73-2cbf-424a-af32-f3d41524e705

3. Next we want to authenticate to the AKS server: az aks get-credentials --name w255-aks --resource-group w255 --overwrite-existing
4. We want to set our context to w255-aks so that we modify files server side: kubectl config use-context w255-aks
5. Next we want to authenticate into the ACR to push our image for use in deployment: az acr login --name w255mids
6. At this point we can build our docker image, tag it to match the tage we specified in our .YAML files, and push it to ACR
7. From here we can deploy our application
8. We want to check the status of the pods to ensure our redis and deployment is running as expected
